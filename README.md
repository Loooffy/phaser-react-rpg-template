# Phaser RPG with React based UI

<kbd>phaser-react-rpg</kbd> is a template for making [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) RPG games with the [React](https://react.dev/) UI system.
The template is generated from [`phaser-rpg`](https://github.com/remarkablegames/phaser-rpg), then using [`template-react-ts`](https://github.com/phaserjs/template-react-ts) and [`top-down-react-phaser-game-template`](https://github.com/blopa/top-down-react-phaser-game-template) as references for integrating React.

## Quick start

### `npm start`

Runs the game in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to view it in the browser.

Or, open the game app from other devices on LAN and connect via `http://<you-local-machine-LAN-ip>:8888`

## Gameplay

This template provides basic player movement controls and a React Menu Component.

Use `WASD` to move the player, `ESC` to toggle the menu, and `SPACE` to trigger messagebox when the player is facing the sign.

## Develope

Create your own phaser game scenes in src/game/sceces.
Create your own React components in src/components.
